# Little Smalltalk

This contains the implementations of A Little Smalltalk from the
former "A Little Smalltalk" project. I'm not actively working on
any of these now, but keep the sources here to help keep this
historical system from being lost.

# Versions

## v1

The original, and therefore oldest implementation. As of November
2014, this is working under OS X Yosemite on a 2013 MacBook Air.

## v2

As of November 2014, this partially builds under OS X Yosemite, but
fails to run.

## v3

This is the version I've done the most work on. I've tested it on
various Linux and OS X releases.

## v4

A significant rewrite, this is fairly modern and has a significantly
smaller and simpler implementation.

As of April 2017, this version:

* Works on 64-bit, OS X, and Cygwin (at least it doesn't crash on
  light testing) and also when compiled with -m32 for 32-bit mode.

## v5

An updated variation of LST v4. This was being worked on by Danny
Reinhold and others, but has been frozen since a server hack on
the littlesmalltalk.org website.

This is working on OS X Yosemite as of November 2014.

## smallworld

A Java implementation.

# Credits

My thanks go to Timothy Budd for creating this, Danny Reinhold for
obtaining permissions to release and update these, and Dmitry Geurkov
for sending me patches to fix several issues with lst1.
